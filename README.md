# gh-actions-go

This repository contains the code developed during the "Continuous Integration" classes on Fullcycle program.

It's a simple Golang application that sums 10 + 10 and prints on screen, and a test for this sum function.

The main point is the CI with Github Actions, which run the tests, build a Docker image with our application and then push it to Docker Hub.

Here the link to the pushed image:
